# Vehicle_Number_Plate_Detection
Vehicle number plate detection is a computer vision practice that allows devices to read the number plates on vehicles without human interaction. Typical system include a digital image capture unit, a processing unit and algorithm for analyzing and recognizing the data/image.
	The analytics, identification, efficiency and convenience are the best benefits for the recognition of the plates. It even helps in understanding the process of  using optical character recognition which is a new trend in the tech mart. It mainly aims for the security of the society with advanced tech. 
Libraries used:
Yolo V4 : Is an object detection algorithm in real-time that recognizes various objects in a single enclosure
